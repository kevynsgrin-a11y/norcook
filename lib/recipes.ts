    cookingTime: '2 hr 30 min',
    difficulty: 'Moderate',
    rating: 4.9,
    reviews: 2140,
    mainIngredients: ['Wheat flour', 'Cardamom', 'Butter', 'Cinnamon', 'Pearl sugar'],
    history: [
      'The skillingsbolle — literally the "shilling bun" — takes its name from the copper coin it once cost on the wharfs of Bergen. For generations it was the everyday indulgence of a rain-soaked harbour city, sold warm from bakeries lining the Bryggen waterfront.',
      'In the last decade it leapt from regional treat to global phenomenon. A single cross-section photograph — that impossibly soft, laminated spiral — turned the humble bun into one of the most photographed pastries on the internet, launching a wave of Nordic baking that continues today.',
      'What sets the Norwegian version apart from its Swedish cousin is restraint: less sugar, a heavier hand with cardamom, and a looser, almost custardy centre that stays molten far longer than you would expect.',
    ],
    ingredients: [
      '500 g strong wheat flour',
      '250 ml whole milk, lukewarm',
      '75 g butter, softened',
      '75 g caster sugar',
      '1 tbsp freshly ground cardamom',
      '25 g fresh yeast (or 9 g dried)',
      '1 tsp fine sea salt',
      'For the filling: 100 g butter, 100 g brown sugar, 2 tbsp cinnamon',
      'Pearl sugar and one beaten egg, to finish',
    ],
    steps: [
      'Warm the milk to blood temperature and dissolve the yeast into it. Let it stand for five minutes until it begins to foam.',
      'Combine flour, sugar, cardamom and salt. Add the milk mixture and softened butter, then knead for 8–10 minutes until the dough is smooth, glossy and pulls cleanly from the bowl.',
      'Cover and prove in a warm place for about one hour, until doubled in size.',
      'Roll the dough into a large rectangle. Spread the softened butter to the edges, then scatter over the brown sugar and cinnamon.',
      'Roll into a tight log, slice into 12 even pieces, and set on lined trays with room to spread. Prove for a further 30–40 minutes.',
      'Brush with beaten egg, shower with pearl sugar, and bake at 220°C for 10–12 minutes until deep gold. Cool just enough to handle — they are best barely warm.',
    ],
    chefTips: [
      'Grind your cardamom fresh from whole pods. Pre-ground powder loses its citrus-eucalyptus lift within weeks and it is the single most important flavour here.',
